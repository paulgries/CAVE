# Session Database

Cave uses a lightweight file-based session store to persist analysis data between CLI commands. There is no external database — everything is written to a single JSON file in your operating system's temp directory.

## How It Works

When Cave runs, it creates a session file at:

`<os.tmpdir()>/clean-arch-cli-session.json`

For example on macOS/Linux this is typically `/tmp/clean-arch-cli-session.json`, and on Windows `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Temp\clean-arch-cli-session.json`.

The `SessionDB` class is a generic key-value store that reads and writes this file synchronously. It is typed against `SessionData`, which defines the full shape of everything Cave tracks about your project.

:::note
Always call `.load()` before any read operation — the in-memory state is not automatically synced from disk. Whenever an instance of the `SessionDBAccess` is created `.load()` is run.

## SessionData Structure

This is the top-level type stored in the session file:

| Field           | Type             | Description                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `projectName`   | `string`         | Name of the project being analyzed            |
| `numUseCases`   | `number`         | Total number of use cases found               |
| `numViolations` | `number`         | Total number of clean architecture violations |
| `useCases`      | `UseCaseEntry[]` | Per-use-case breakdown (see below)            |
| `files`         | `FileStorage[]`  | All scanned files and their classifications   |
| `edges`         | `EdgeStorage[]`  | Dependency edges between nodes                |
| `nodes`         | `NodeStorage[]`  | All nodes discovered in the project           |

### Use Case Entry

Each entry in the `useCases` array contains:

| Field            | Type                       | Description                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | `string`                   | Unique identifier                     |
| `name`           | `string`                   | Use case name                         |
| `outNeighbours`  | `neighbourMap`             | Adjacency map of node dependencies    |
| `fileKeys`       | `string[]`                 | References into the `files` array     |
| `violationEdges` | `[cleanNode, cleanNode][]` | Edges that violate clean architecture |
| `missingNodes`   | `cleanNode[]`              | Expected nodes that were not found    |

## Storage Types

### `FileStorage`

Represents a single scanned file:

| Field      | Type                                                              | Description                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `filePath` | `string`                                                          | Absolute path to the file                    |
| `fileType` | `"java" \| "python" \| "javascript" \| "typescript" \| "unknown"` | The programming language of the source file  |
| `layer`    | `cleanLayer`                                                      | Which clean architecture layer it belongs to |
| `node`     | `cleanNode`                                                       | The node type it represents                  |

### `EdgeStorage`

Represents a dependency between two nodes:

| Field    | Type                                | Description                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `id`     | `string`                            | Unique edge identifier            |
| `source` | `string`                            | Source node name                  |
| `target` | `string`                            | Target node name                  |
| `type`   | `"DEPENDENCY"`                      | Always `DEPENDENCY`               |
| `status` | `"VALID" \| "INCORRECT_DEPENDENCY"` | Whether the dependency is allowed |

### `NodeStorage`

Represents a single node in the architecture graph:

| Field      | Type                                  | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `id`       | `string`                              | Unique node identifier         |
| `name`     | `string?`                             | Display name                   |
| `filePath` | `string?`                             | Path to the corresponding file |
| `type`     | `cleanNode`                           | Node type classification       |
| `layer`    | `cleanLayer`                          | Clean architecture layer       |
| `status`   | `"VALID" \| "MISSING" \| "VIOLATION"` | Health status of the node      |

## Clean Architecture Layers

Cave maps every file to one of four clean architecture layers:

| Value                      | Layer                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `enterpriseBusinessRules`  | Entities                            |
| `applicationBusinessRules` | Use Cases                           |
| `interfaceAdapters`        | Controllers, Presenters, ViewModels |
| `frameworksAndDrivers`     | Views, Databases, Data Access       |

## Node Types

Cave recognises the following node types across all layers:

| Node                                                                          | Layer                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `entities`                                                                    | Enterprise Business Rules  |
| `inputBoundary` `inputData` `outputBoundary` `outputData` `useCaseInteractor` | Application Business Rules |
| `controller` `presenter` `viewModel`                                          | Interface Adapters         |
| `view` `dataAccess` `dataAccessInterface` `database`                          | Frameworks & Drivers       |

## `neighbourMap`

The `neighbourMap` type describes which node types each node is allowed (or found) to depend on:

```typescript
type neighbourMap = Record<cleanNode, cleanNode[]>;
```

For example, a `controller` entry in the map would list all the node types it has outgoing dependencies to. This is used to detect violations — if a dependency points inward past the allowed boundary, it is flagged as `INCORRECT_DEPENDENCY`.
